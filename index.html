  <h2 class = "transition"> Some stuff about me! </h2>
  <p class = "bio"> I'm Alexis Harris and I'm a '20 at Dartmouth from New York City. I currently plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Religion! </p>
  <p class = "bio"> I've been programming since I was a freshman in high school. I have experience coding in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and more! I really enjoy coding because it enables me to solve problems and create new things. I'd be excited to work with the DALI Lab because the projects being created are super cool and innovative and I'd love to be a part of that!</p>
  <h3 class = "transition"> A few fun facts... </h3>

  <p class = "bio"> 2) I'm an all-state pole vaulter </p>
  <p class = "bio"> 3) I'm terrified of ostriches </p>
