  <h2 class = "transition"> Some stuff about me! </h2>
  <p class = "bio"> I'm Alexis Harris and I'm a '20 at Dartmouth from New York City. I currently plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Religion! </p>
  <p class = "bio"> I've been programming since I was a freshman in high school. I have the most experience coding in Java, Python, HTML and CSS! I really like to code because it enables me to solve cool problems and create new things. I also love how logical and methodical coding is, and that feeling when my code actually runs and works. </p>
  <p class = "bio"> I'd be excited to work with the DALI Lab because the projects in it are super cool and innovative. I think the lab is an awesome, fun learning environment, and I'd love to be a part of it! As a first term dev in the lab, I'd be excited to learn as much as I can about developing with a group. I'd also be excited to build on my web and app development skills! </p>
  <h3 class = "transition"> A few fun facts... </h3>
  <p class = "bio"> 1) I love being outside, boat rides and ice cream (especially Ice Cream Fore-U) </p>
  <p class = "bio"> 2) I like to travel!</p>
