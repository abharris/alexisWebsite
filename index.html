  <h2 class = "transition"> Some stuff about me! </h2>
  <p class = "bio"> I'm Alexis Harris and I'm a '20 at Dartmouth from New York City. I currently plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Religion! </p>
  <p class = "bio"> I've been programming since I was a freshman in high school. I have the most experience coding in Java, Python, HTML and CSS! I really like to code because it enables me to solve cool problems and create new things. I'd be excited to work with the DALI Lab because the projects in it are super cool and innovative. I think the lab is an awesome, fun learning environment I'd love to be a part of!</p>
  <h3 class = "transition"> A few fun facts... </h3>
  <p class = "bio"> 1) I love being outside, boat rides and ice cream (especially Ice Cream Fore-U) </p>
  <p class = "bio"> 2) I'm an all-state pole vaulter </p>
  <p class = "bio"> 3) I have a Shih Tzu named Coco </p>
